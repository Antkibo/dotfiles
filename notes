* Strings

- Create strings with String::new() or String::from(&str)
- Two types of string: String and &str

* Numbers

- std::cmp::Ordering can be used to compare numbers. It returns one of three possible values: Ordering::Less, Ordering::Equal, and Ordering::Greater
- The rand crate can be used to generate random numbers
- Numbers have the to_string() method. It parses them to a String object
- Types:

	1. 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, size
	2. Binary, Octal, Decimal, Hexadecimal, Byte

* Cargo

- Use cargo doc to generate docs for your crate. Supply itwith --open flag to open it in a browser

* Variables

- Vars are immutable by default. The 'mut' preffix makes a variable mutable
- Constants are always immutable, must be explicitly typed, and may only be set to a constant expression
- Vars can be shadowed by re-declaring them with a let statement. This allows us to change their type
