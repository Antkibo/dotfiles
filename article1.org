* Burning Crusade zones ranked from least to best
** Introduction
** Body
*** Terokkar Forest
Pros:
- Great end-game content (Skettis, fishing stuff, etc.)
- Has Shattrath
-
*** Hellfire Peninsula
Pros:
- Story heavy
- Elements that we would see further in the expansion are present (arakkoa, broken slavery, Kael'thas, Cenarion Expedition, void elementals, Illidan, etc.)
- Terrain is not flat but angled. In some places it's like sliding into the void. This leads to zones like Shatter Point (Alliance) or the void elementals place.
- Best lead-in into its dungeons
Cons:
- Too big, really
- Horde-sided lore, though Alliance gets more lore figures

*** Bladespire Mountains
*** Shadowmoon Valley
*** Netherstorm
*** Zangarmarsh
*** Nagrand
** Conclusion
