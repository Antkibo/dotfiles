* First Campaign: The Onslaught of Kalimdor (orcs)

"Enemies encrouch the orc nation of Durotar from all sides while unrest brews within. Will its people strive to uphold their new way of life, as given by Thrall, or choose to return to their old, bloodthirsty ways?"

1. Characters:

- Kalimeta Orogurg. A veteran of the Third War, young by orc standards, Kalimeta is from the Warsong Clan and was besides Hellscream as they drank the Blood of Mannoroth. After the Battle of Mount Hyjal, he joined Thrall's elite force, the Kor'kron, and assisted him in founding the new nation of Durotar. Some time later, he was stationed in the southern Barrens where he now leads a band of outriders, patrolling the zone for danger.

    Kalimeta is a warrior with a touch of shaman. He has trained as an outrider since childhood, as per the clan tradition, and is a renowed commander and strategist. During his time as Thrall's aide, he was impressed by his leader's wisdom and headed his call to embrace shamanism.

    He feels guilty for drinking the Blood of Mannoroth and in doing so supporting his brothers descend to madness. For him, duty is penance, and he prays constantly for the spirits to quicken the soul of all orcs and guide them towards a brighter future.

    He whistles, something he took from the humans and night elves he fought along with during the Third War. He dislikes dwarves' passion for drink. He is friends with several Draenei; he respects them as great shamans. He has a companion, Logra, and two sons.
