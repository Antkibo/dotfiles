What is HTML? HTML is a document format used to describe the semantic structure of web pages. It is defined by the W3C and its latest version is HTML 5.

HTML consists of tags that have a meaning and enclose (or not) content to be rendered.

HTML doesn't deal with the visual representation of a web page, that has to be described separately in CSS. If the page doesn't possess a stylesheet, the browser styles the page using its default style.
