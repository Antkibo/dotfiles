[ Strings ]

"Strings literals are in double quotes."

"
  Strings literals can span 
  multiple lines.
"

''

  It strips leading whitespace
''

("ab" + "cd") => "abcd"

- Antiquotation (${}) lets you embed values into strings

"Your home directory is ${builtins.getEnv "HOME"}"

- A relative path is resolved to an absolute path at parse time
