# Describe what the internet is.

// The internet is not the world wide web
// The internet is the foundation of the world wide web
// Requests, packets, backends
// Data is split in packets and send through several ways
// Those packets then converge in the client at the right order to show the content

It's a network of networks (i.e. several computers talking to each other through common protocols)

# Describe what packets are and how they are used to transfer data.

# Understand the differences between a web page, web server, web browser and search engine.

A web page is a document that instructs a browser on how content should be rendered. A web server is a computer that hosts websites -- "hosting" meaning that all web pages and associated files are available on that computer. A web browser is a program that retrieves and displays web pages. A search engine, like Google, let's you make a query and search among many pages to see if there are matches.

# Briefly explain what a client is.

Someone who makes a request.

# Briefly explain what a server is.

Someone who answers a request.

# Explain what IP addresses are

It the unique name of a device on the internet.

# Explain what DNS servers are.
# In your own words, explain what happens when you run a search on google.com.

/* How the internet works:
    - Computers -> Router (to connect computers) -> Modem (to send data through the telephone infrastructure) -> ISP 1 (to send data to other ISPs) <- ISP 2 (the receiver) -> Modem 2 (data was sent through telephone lines) -> Router -> Computer/Server (that holds the data we want to access)
