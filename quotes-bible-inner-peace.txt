"Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble."
â€” Matthew 6:34 ESV

In many places in the Bible we are told not to worry, or be anxious, or be fearful about what the future may hold. Indeed, the Apostle Paul said that we shouldn't be anxious about anything (Philippians 4:6). Apart from the torment they put us through, the trouble with worry, anxiety, and fear is that they are a waste of time. Instead of spending our time dealing with what we have been called to do today, we waste it by worrying and being anxious about how we will deal with what we have to do tomorrow.

Although there is nothing wrong with making plans for the future, there is a lot wrong with worrying and being anxious about the future. Life in Christ is meant to be lived day by day. Tomorrow is tomorrow and should be dealt with then. Today is today and should be dealt with now. All of us have plenty to do today. It needs everything we have to give to it. Worry and anxiety about tomorrow interfere with what is present before us; they add nothing to our purpose in life; they hold us back in every respect.

Christians have been given the Holy Spirit and the Spirit energizes and equips us for everything we have been called by God to do. One might say that we have been anointed by the Holy Spirit to do whatever it is we have to do. The anointing we have for today, however, is for today, not for tomorrow. The anointing for tomorrow will come tomorrow. If we have worry and anxiety about tomrrow, it is a good indication that we have moved on ahead of the anointing of the Holy Spirit. We are then operating in the strength of our own power and are then trying to figure everything out on our own. Consequently, we worry and have anxiety because we have placed the cares and concerns of tomorrow on our own shoulders, instead of relying on the strength and enablement of the Holy Spirit.

God's grace and anointing are for today. Don't waste today worrying and being anxious about tomorrow. Cast your anxieties about the future on God, because He cares for you (I Peter 5:7).

Matthew 28:20  I am with you alway.

It is well there is One who is ever the same, and who is ever with us. It is well there is one stable rock amidst the billows of the sea of life. O my soul, set not thine affections upon rusting, moth-eaten, decaying treasures, but set thine heart upon him who abides forever faithful to thee. Build not thine house upon the moving quicksands of a deceitful world, but found thy hopes upon this rock, which, amid descending rain and roaring floods, shall stand immovably secure. My soul, I charge thee, lay up thy treasure in the only secure cabinet; store thy jewels where thou canst never lose them. Put thine all in Christ; set all thine affections on his person, all thy hope in his merit, all thy trust in his efficacious blood, all thy joy in his presence, and so thou mayest laugh at loss, and defy destruction. Remember that all the flowers in the world's garden fade by turns, and the day cometh when nothing will be left but the black, cold earth. Death's black extinguisher must soon put out thy candle. Oh! how sweet to have sunlight when the candle is gone! The dark flood must soon roll between thee and all thou hast; then wed thine heart to him who will never leave thee; trust thyself with him who will go with thee through the black and surging current of death's stream, and who will land thee safely on the celestial shore, and make thee sit with him in heavenly places forever. Go, sorrowing son of affliction, tell thy secrets to the Friend who sticketh closer than a brother. Trust all thy concerns with him who never can be taken from thee, who will never leave thee, and who will never let thee leave him, even "Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today, and forever." "Lo, I am with you alway," is enough for my soul to live upon, let who will forsake me.

Joshua 1:7  Only be thou strong and very courageous.

Our God's tender love for his servants makes him concerned for the state of their inward feelings. He desires them to be of good courage. Some esteem it a small thing for a believer to be vexed with doubts and fears, but God thinks not so. From this text it is plain that our Master would not have us entangled with fears. He would have us without carefulness, without doubt, without cowardice. Our Master does not think so lightly of our unbelief as we do. When we are desponding we are subject to a grievous malady, not to be trifled with, but to be carried at once to the beloved Physician. Our Lord loveth not to see our countenance sad. It was a law of Ahasuerus that no one should come into the king's court dressed in mourning: this is not the law of the King of kings, for we may come mourning as we are; but still he would have us put off the spirit of heaviness, and put on the garment of praise, for there is much reason to rejoice. The Christian man ought to be of a courageous spirit, in order that he may glorify the Lord by enduring trials in an heroic manner. If he be fearful and fainthearted, it will dishonor his God. Besides, what a bad example it is. This disease of doubtfulness and discouragement is an epidemic which soon spreads amongst the Lord's flock. One downcast believer makes twenty souls sad. Moreover, unless your courage is kept up, Satan will be too much for you. Let your spirit be joyful in God your Saviour, the joy of the Lord shall be your strength, and no fiend of hell shall make headway against you; but cowardice throws down the banner. Moreover, labor is light to a man of cheerful spirit; and success waits upon cheerfulness. The man who toils, rejoicing in his God, believing with all his heart, has success guaranteed. He who sows in hope shall reap in joy; therefore, dear reader, "be thou strong, and very courageous."
