I do remember a time some time ago when
life was great
And everybody I knew around was full of
ha-ppi-ness

Seriousness was out
Playtime was in

There were many smiles
It was great you see

I do remember a time when all the sky was made
of pure blue
And summer days full of kids running
without a care

Trees dogs and cats
lived in peace with men

But times go forward
this is destiny

What did go wrong?
Choosing money over life
How did it pass?
Internet milked dry

Let's fight anew
And if we lose
Let's all remember
The good times
