* Styling text

** Fundamentals

The CSS properties used to style text generally fall into two categories: font styles and text layout styles.

1. Font styles are properties that affect the font that is applied to the text.
2. Text layout styles are properties that affect the spacing and other layout features of the text.

*** Size

The root element <html> has its font-size set to 16px as standard across browsers. An <h1> element has a size of 2em by default, so it will have a final size of 32px.

+ Avoid setting the font-size of container elements where possible.
