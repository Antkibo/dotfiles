** Solving equations

To solve an equation such as:

    x^{2} - 4 = 45

Is to answer "What is the value of x?" To do so we manipulate the original equation until we get one that lookes like this:

    x = only numbers

** Numbers

Numbers are classified according to the following sets:

1. Natural
2. Integers
3. Rational
4. Real
5. Complex

*** Operations on numbers

1. Addition (+)
   - Commutative
   - Associative
2. Substraction (-)
3. Multiplication (no special symbol is used in modern notation)
   - Commutative
   - Associative
4. Division (divide /a/ into /b/ equal parts)
5. Exponentiation (negative exponents mean "divide by" and fractional exponents describe square-root-like operations)
   - The n^{th} root of /a/ is a number which, when multiplied together n times, will give a.
   - Due to the commutative rule, a^{2/3} can be written "^{3}‚àö2^{2}" or (^{3}‚àö2)^{2}.

*** Operator precedence

1. Exponents and roots
2. Products and divisions
3. Additions and substractions

** Variables

Placeholders names for any number or unknown.


*** Variable names

Common naming patterns for variables:

- x ‚Äî general name for the unknown
- v ‚Äî velocity
- œë, Œ¶ ‚Äî angles
- x_{i}, x_{f} ‚Äî an object's initial and final position
- X ‚Äî random variable in probability
- C ‚Äî costs in business along with P for profit and R for revenue

* Glossary

1. '=' is the equality symbol.
2. An equal sign with three lines means "equivalent to" and is used when two mathematical objects are identical. Equivalence is a stronger relation than equality.
3. '|x|' is the absolute value of x.
4. Sets are groups of unique values of the same kind
5. Algebraic numbers are those who are solutions to a polynomial equation. Transcendental numbers, like ùõë or ùêû, are those who are not the solutions to any polynomial equation.
6. A polynomial is a mathematical expression consisting of variables and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, substraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponentation of variables.
