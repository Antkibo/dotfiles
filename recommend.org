* HTML

** <p> element

1. Don't use empty <p> elements to add space between other elements.
2. You can achieve first-line indentation with CSS:

#+BEGIN_SRC css
p {
  margin: 0;
  /* Where ch is a unit that means "relative to the width of the '0' (zero)" */
  text-indent: 3ch;
}
#+END_SRC

** <h1>â€“<h6> elements

1. Have only one <h1> element per page and use it to describe the overall purpose of the content.
2. Don't use headings to resize text.
3. Don't skip heading levels: always start from <h1>, followed by <h2>, and so on.
4. Nest your headings as subsections to reflect the organization of the page content.
5. Headings can also be used to label sectioning content, using aria-labelledby, for screen readers when there is more than one sectioning element on the same page. For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<header>
  <nav aria-labelledby="primary-navigation">
    <h2 id="primary-navigation">Primary navigation</h2>
    <!-- navigation items -->
  </nav>
</header>

<footer>
  <nav aria-labelledby="footer-navigation">
    <h2 id="footer-navigation">Footer navigation</h2>
    <!-- navigation items -->
  </nav>
</footer>
#+END_SRC

** When to use <img> vs <div> and background-image

1. If you want to use an image as pure decoration, use the CSS property /background-image/.
2. If your image is part of the *content*, use an <img> element.

** Styling links

- Use underlining for links, but not for other things.
- Make them react in some way when hovered/focused, and in a slightly different way when activated.
